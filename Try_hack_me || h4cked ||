downloaded a wireshark file.
looked around and found out the attacker is tring to login in to ftp server.
right clicked on it to get tcp stream and got user name and password 
jenny:password123

looked around for pwd got the current working directory.
13. The project can be used to install a stealthy backdoor on the system. It can be very hard to detect. What is this 	type of backdoor called?
 -> rootkit

Target IP : 10.10.102.32
since attacker has changed password nad we have username 
using Hydra to brute force
got new password
[21][ftp] host: 10.10.102.32   login: jenny   password: 987654321

login in to ftp
now we can do what the attacker did.

 get shell.php
--reverse shell--
edit it by adding your ip for reverse shell.

run the shell.php using curl or from the browser : http://IP/shell.php

make it stable using python command:

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

since we are on www-data
since there is no perm to switch to root first 
switching to jenny
and again to root user.
and look for flag.txt
